My Foods
1. Correct, you got it right all good.

Library (USDA)
2.1. Yes, must press keyboard to start search
2.2. Yes on each new keyboard submit start from page 1, but... if user types what is already in search query so basically same string, do nothing, because it would be useless api call.
2.3. Yes, on scroll more pages correct.
2.4. Yes, on new search start from page 1.

Community
2.1. Yes, but question: memory data causes lag or only if i render them? because if massive data causes lag dispite not being rendered, i might rethink how to fetch community foods from my API later.
2.2. Yes, only 10 first (page 1).
2.3. Yes, more scroll = next pages.
2.4. Exactly.

Your Questions - My Answers
1. I think i prefer load more button, good suggestion... because its more direct, user knows there's more of the food and it prevents accidental call if not needed, thanks for the suggestion (same for community).
2. Same number of items per page as library...
3. Considering we are doing button instead, i dont think this is needed.
